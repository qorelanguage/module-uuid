***********
version 1.2
***********

took the following steps to ensure consistent behavior on all platforms:
* modified the default output (without any flags) to always be a string with
  lower-case hex digit letters
* updated implementation to manage case even if the uuid library does not
  support the uuid_unparse_lower() and uuid_unparse_upper() functions

added support for building the module on Windows and with the OSSP UUID library
note that generation flags are ignored on Windows


***********
version 1.1
***********

added the following static method allowing a string UUID to be returned
immediately:

static UUID::get(int $gen_flags = UUID::None, int $str_flags = UUID::None) returns string

minor corrections were made in the documentation
