Qore UUID module (uuid)

INTRODUCTION
------------
The Qore uuid module provides the ability to generate and parse UUIDs, Universally Unique IDentifiers
For more information about UUIDs, see:
    	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_Unique_Identifier

Basically this module provides a Qore-language API to libuuid on UNIX systems

see docs for more information


LICENSE
-------
The source code is released under the LGPL 2.1 and MIT licenses; either license
may be used at the user's discretion.  Note that both licenses are treated
equally by the Qore library in the sense that both licenses allow the module
to be loaded without restrictions by the Qore library (even when the Qore
library is initialized in GPL mode).
See COPYING.MIT and COPYING.LGPL for details on the open-source licenses.


BUILDING
--------
Requires qore 0.8.0+ and libuuid to build and run

to configure the build, execute
   	configure --disable-debug

if the qore library cannot be found, then you can use:
   	configure --disable-debug --with-qore=<dir>

if libuuid cannot be found, then you can use:
   	configure --disable-debug --with-libuuid=<dir>

The qore binary also needs to be in the path so configure can determine the module directory

Then execute

make && make install

(or 'make && sudo make install' as needed)
